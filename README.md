# Welcome to my Personal/Portfolio Website Repo

This is my portfolio website where I showcase some cool things about myself. My aim for this website was to keep it simple, clean, modern, coherent and 'fun'. This is the source code, you can find the deployed version [here](https://mohammadabh.me/).

## Tech Stack Used

This website was built using the following technologies:

1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. [React](https://reactjs.org/)
3. [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

## Scripts

Have a look at the package.json for more details about the scripts, the two mains ones:

- `yarn run deploy`: Deploys the application to GitHub pages

> ps. Don't forget to do `yarn install`
